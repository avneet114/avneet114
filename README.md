# 👋 Helloooooooo, I’m Avneet :)

I’m a CS + Business student at Lehigh University who builds products, tells stories, and moves to countries before knowing the language. I care about tech that actually creates an impact in the world. For people, for the planet, for the ones usually left out of the conversation.

I keep my stories and deeper project write-ups on my 
# 💌 website: http://avneetgrewal114.com/

# ⚠️ Quick note about my commit history (aka why it’s not all green):
If my activity graph looks quieter than you’d expect, here’s why:
- A lot of my collaborative work lives in private repositories (classes, team projects, research work)
- Some projects were built in shared org repos or on different platforms (Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.)

So yeah, I promise I’m building even when the graph isn’t glowing neon green 😌

# 🧠 What I’m Exploring Lately
- Full-stack web apps (front-end UX + back-end logic)
- AI-assisted workflows & tooling
- Turning my everyday problems into side projects
- Iceskating
- Canon R50
